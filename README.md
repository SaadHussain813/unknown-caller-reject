# unknown-caller-reject

An android application for blocking only callers without caller ID.

E.g. those annoying irks who block their number (PPI, scammers etc) and other agents of misfortune.

This app blocks calls which come up as UNKNOWN or PRIVATE.

It allows ALL other numbers, e.g. where you can see a phone number of the caller, the call is not blocked.

This app is available on the playstore at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namitservices.ucr&hl=en_GB

Please help me improve this app, help beat the scammers and smurfs who hide their numbers !
