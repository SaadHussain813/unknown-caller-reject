# unknown-caller-reject

An android application for blocking only callers without caller ID.

E.g. those annoying irks who block their number (PPI, scammers etc) and other agents of misfortune.

This app blocks calls which come up as UNKNOWN or PRIVATE.

It allows ALL other numbers, e.g. where you can see a phone number of the caller, the call is not blocked.
